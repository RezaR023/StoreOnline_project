    "As an example: we wanna build an application and publish it in rezabuy.com. This website will have two parts or two applications. A front-end that is the part that is loaded inside a web browser on a client machine. The back-end is the part that runs on a web server, and is resposlibe for data processing, validating business rules, etc. After pointing your browser to rezabuy.com. This address is called URL (Uniform resource locator). It is basically a way to locate a source on the interent. The source can be web page, image video, pdf, so on. Then, your browser sends a request to the server to say for example show the home page. The web sever takes this request and returns a reponse. This data exchange is defined by a protocol called HTTP, Hypertext Transfer Protcol. It defines how servers and clients can communicate.\n",
    "    Two methods of sending reponse to the clients: One option is to generate the requested page (HTML) on the server and return it to the client. We use HTML (Hypertext Markup Language, a simple language for representing web pages and their content). So, in other hand, one option is to generate the web page on the server and return an HTML document to the clients. The other option is to return only data (like the list of products) needed on the requested page and have the client to generate the page.\n",
    "    So, In the second case, the server essentially become a gateway to the data. On the server, we can provide endpoints that the clients can talk to, to get or save various pieces of data. So, we can provide an endpoint to get the list of products, and another endpoint to get the list of orders someone has placed. All these endpoints represent the interface that clients can use to talk to the server."

So, with this decoupling, we can reuse this app in any other project. Now. let's see how we can find the tags for a given product. So, let's go to our database in DataGrip and look at the \"django_content_type\" table. In this table, we can see all the models we have in our application. Now, look at the \"taggeditem\" table. It has few columns like id, object_id, content_type_id, and tag_id. To find the tags for a given product, first we have to find the \"content_type_id\" of the product model. So, once we find it, we can go to the \"taggeditem\" table and write a query to  filter all records where content_type_id is equal to that for product model and object_id equals the id of the product whose tags we want to find out.

    "By default, our forms include basic data validation logic. For example, because we have defined all the fields in product model as required fields, none of them are nullable and if you try to save the form of \"ADD PRODUCT\", without supply any data, we get the validation errors like \"This field is required\" and so on. So, how we can customize this validation here. For example, making the description field nullable. Back to the product class and make the description field (null=True). Please note that this argument applies to our database. To make this field optional in the admin interface, we should set another argument (null=True, blank=True). Then, make migration and migrate and apply to the database. \n",

    "What about the \"unit_price\". We can not type any character like strings since the type of this field is decimal and it only accept numbers. But, we are still free to set zero or negative numbers. To set a validation limit for this, we need to import MinValueValidator from django.core.validators. In this module, we have a bunch of validators. For a complete list of vlidators, google \"django validators\" and you can see like EmailValidator, URLValidator, MaxValueValidator, MinValueValidator, and so on. Then, go to the Product model and add an argument including a list of validator objects in the unit_price field."
