And this is where APIs (Application Programming Interface) come to the picture. Building an API is essentially building an interface that client apps can use to get or save the data. APIs are going to have a bunch of endpoints for different purposes. So, we can have an end point for getting the list of products as well as creating, updating, and deleting them. We can have other endpoints for managing our shopping carts, orders, and so on. Client apps can send requests to these endpoints and get or save products, orders, shopping carts, etc.. \n",

An API that confirm these ruls called RESTful. There are three concepts that everyone shoul know: resources, resource representations, and HTTP methods."

    "Resources in a RESTful API is objects in our application like Product, Cart, Collection. These resources are avalilable on the web and client applicaton can access them using URLs (Uniform Resource Locator). So, URL is way to locate a resource on the web. It is basically a web address. Assuming our website is hosted, for example, at http://rezabuy.com, we can access all products in  http://rezabuy.com/products or access an individual product http://rezabuy.com/products/1. A resource can contain other resources like reviews http://rezabuy.com/products/1/reviews or for an especific review http://rezabuy.com/products/1/reviews/1. As a general rule of thumb, we should not nest resources too deep, say two rows is fine, but beyond that the URL can get complex and unmanagable. The above pattern or consistency across these URLs is one of the attributes of RESTful APIs. So, if we simply follow this pattern are API will be familiar and easy to understand to others. "

    "We can identify a resource using it's URL. When we hit that URL, the server returns the resource in a certain format or representation. Different way of representations are HTML, XML (an old format for representing data), or JSON (a modern format that replaces XML). None of these are an internal representation of resources on the server. In other words, on the server, we identify a resource like Product, using an object or an instance of a python class. But, we return this to the client, we represent it as a HTML, XML, or JSON. Because these are the formats that clients can understand. REST does not dictate any format or representation we should use. JSON stands for JavaScripts Object Notation. Here you see a JSON representation of a product that uses a dictionary (key-value pairs) where keis are always string format (should be surrounded by double quote) but the value can be any format like string, number, boolan, an another object (in the curly braces {}), array (like []) and so on:"

    "when building RESTful APIs, we expose one or more endpoints for clients. each endpoind may support various kinds of operations. So, some endpoints may only allow reading data, while others may allow modifying data as well. This is where HTTP method comes to the picture. Using HTTP methods, the client can tell the server what it wants to do with the resource. So, HTTP defines method like \"GET\" for getting a resource or a collection of resources, \"POST\" for creating a resource, \"PUT\" for updating the resource, \"PATCH\" for updating a part of the resource like a subset of a properties, and \"DELETE\" for deleting a resource. For example, we are going to create a product. In our client app, we send a \"POST /product\" request to the products endpoint. So, the server knows we want to create a product. But, where is the product we want to create? We insert this product like a JSON object in the body of the request:\n",
    "\n",
    "> {\n",
    "> \"title\": \"...\",\n",
    "> \"price\": 10\n",
    ">}\n",
    "\n",
    "The server will read this product and create it. Now, let's we want to update our product. First, we need to ask we want to update all the properties or just a subset of that. If we want to update all properties, we sould send a \"PUT\" request. Otherwise, we should send a \"PATCH\" request to the related URL (like /products/1). Similar to creating a product, we should include a product object in the body of the request in a JSON format. So, server will extract this product from the request and update it accordingly. For deleting a product, we should send a \"DELETE /product/1\" request, but, here no need to send a JSON object in the body of the request."
