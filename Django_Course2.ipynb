APIs are going to have a bunch of endpoints for different purposes. So, we can have an end point for getting the list of products as well as creating, updating, and deleting them. We can have other endpoints for managing our shopping carts, orders, and so on. Client apps can send requests to these endpoints and get or save products, orders, shopping carts, etc.. \n",

These resources are avalilable on the web and client applicaton can access them using URLs (Uniform Resource Locator). So, URL is way to locate a resource on the web. It is basically a web address. Assuming our website is hosted, for example, at http://rezabuy.com, we can access all products in  http://rezabuy.com/products or access an individual product http://rezabuy.com/products/1. A resource can contain other resources like reviews http://rezabuy.com/products/1/reviews or for an especific review http://rezabuy.com/products/1/reviews/1. As a general rule of thumb, we should not nest resources too deep, say two rows is fine, but beyond that the URL can get complex and unmanagable. The above pattern or consistency across these URLs is one of the attributes of RESTful APIs. So, if we simply follow this pattern are API will be familiar and easy to understand to others. "

None of these are an internal representation of resources on the server. In other words, on the server, we identify a resource like Product, using an object or an instance of a python class. But, we return this to the client, we represent it as a HTML, XML, or JSON. Because these are the formats that clients can understand. REST does not dictate any format or representation we should use. JSON stands for JavaScripts Object Notation. Here you see a JSON representation of a product that uses a dictionary (key-value pairs) where keis are always string format (should be surrounded by double quote) but the value can be any format like string, number, boolan, an another object (in the curly braces {}), array (like []) and so on:"

    "when building RESTful APIs, we expose one or more endpoints for clients. each endpoind may support various kinds of operations. So, some endpoints may only allow reading data, while others may allow modifying data as well. This is where HTTP method comes to the picture. Using HTTP methods, the client can tell the server what it wants to do with the resource. So, HTTP defines method like \"GET\" for getting a resource or a collection of resources, \"POST\" for creating a resource, \"PUT\" for updating the resource, \"PATCH\" for updating a part of the resource like a subset of a properties, and \"DELETE\" for deleting a resource. For example, we are going to create a product. In our client app, we send a \"POST /product\" request to the products endpoint. So, the server knows we want to create a product. But, where is the product we want to create? We insert this product like a JSON object in the body of the request:\n",

If we want to update all properties, we sould send a \"PUT\" request. Otherwise, we should send a \"PATCH\" request to the related URL (like /products/1). Similar to creating a product, we should include a product object in the body of the request in a JSON format. So, server will extract this product from the request and update it accordingly. For deleting a product, we should send a \"DELETE /product/1\" request, but, here no need to send a JSON object in the body of the request."

    "Most of the time, we are not going to use Mixins directly. Instead, we use Conceret View Classes that combine one or more Mixins. These classes are called Generic view. These classes are imported from rest_framework.generics. For example, a class called ListCreateAPIView combines two Mixins (that are its parents as well as GenericAPIView), ListModelMixin and CreateModelMixin. GenericAPIView has a bunch of methods or attributs for overriding in our custom views. For example, we have \"get_queryset()\" for creating a queryset object and \"get_serializer_class()\" for specifying the type of serializer we want to use in our view.\n",

The list method is the results of inheritance from the ListModelMixin class where lists a bunch of objects. The seconde method is \"post()\" method for creating a model object and deligates to the \"create()\" method of the current object which have inherited from the CreateModelMixin. So, a Generic view is a conceret class that combines one or more Mixins and provides handler methods like get(), post(), put(), and delete(). \n",

If you want to have some logics or condictions for creating a queryset or a serializer, we can implement those logics in \"get_queryset()\" and \"get_serializer_class()\" methods. For example, when we want to check the current user and provide different querysets depending on the current user and their permissions. Different users also can have different serializer classes.
